AI Fact Verification Project-G!F
Overview
This project is aimed at developing a web application that uses logistic regression, decision tree classifier, and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to determine the truthfulness of facts. Initially, the system is trained and tested using a geography dataset. However, the intention is to expand the database in the future to cover a wider range of topics and domains.


Why This Project?
1.Combatting Misinformation: In today's digital age, the spread of misinformation and fake news is a significant concern. By developing a fact verification system, we contribute to the efforts of combating misinformation and promoting accurate information dissemination.

2.Enhancing Information Integrity: Ensuring the integrity of information is crucial, especially in domains where factual accuracy is paramount, such as news reporting, academic research, and public information dissemination.

3.Empowering Users: Providing users with a tool to verify the truthfulness of facts empowers them to make informed decisions, avoid spreading false information, and engage critically with online content.
4.Scalability and Adaptability: By initially focusing on a geography dataset and planning to expand to other domains, our project demonstrates scalability and adaptability, ensuring that the fact verification system remains relevant and effective across different topics and datasets.
5.AI Algorithms: By leveraging logistic regression, decision tree classifier, and NLP techniques, the system can analyze textual data and make informed decisions about the truthfulness of statements.
