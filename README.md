<h1 align="center">⭐G!F -Fact Verification Project⭐</h1>


## About the Project
The aim of this project is to develop a user-friendly web application that empowers users to verify the facts they encounter online. By leveraging advanced AI algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree classifier, and NLP, the system can analyze textual data and make informed decisions about the veracity of statements.
This project aims to develop a web application using logistic regression, decision tree classifier, and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to determine the truthfulness of facts. Initially trained and tested using a geography dataset, the project intends to expand the database to cover a wider range of topics and domains in the future.


## **Built with:**

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript :computer:
- **Backend:** Python :snake:
- **Integration** Flask

- ## How to install and run the project
Installation:
1. The project required IDE where you can see and edit the frontend and backend codes. 
2. Frontend Codes edited on VS code and Backend on Jupyter Notebook. 
3. For integration, we require flask, to use flask we need to install Python and its required 
libraries.
4. Use Command Prompt to run Flask.
Run
1. Integration is done using “python app.py “command, use this command and click enter 
3 times.
2. It integrates the frontend and backend and the tool is available on local host.
3. The tool can be accessed by the link provided flask.
4. The link works after the flask debugger starts

   
##How to run the project
1. On visiting the website, the first page or the home page comes which tells about the 
website and has other functionalities related to the website.
2. The Check Button Allows us to go on the Input page where the user can submit the fact,
they want to verify by entering the text in the box and clicking on ‘Submit.’
3. The Clear Button clears the text entered if some wrong text is entered by the user.
4. On submitting the text, the output page is loaded where the result is depicted.
5. Refresh button takes back to input page, where if the user wants than they can again 
ask about any fact.
6. The Home button on Input page takes the user back to home page.
7. The Explore Button on Home page opens explore page where the user can go through 
facts.


## Why This Project?
**1.Combatting Misinformation:** In today's digital age, combating misinformation and fake news is crucial. This project contributes to these efforts by developing a fact verification system.

**2.Enhancing Information Integrity:** Ensuring the integrity of information is vital, especially in domains where factual accuracy is paramount, such as news reporting and academic research.

**3.Empowering Users:** Providing users with a tool to verify facts empowers them to make informed decisions and engage critically with online content.

**4.Scalability and Adaptability:** The project's scalability and adaptability allow it to remain effective across different topics and datasets as it expands beyond geography.

**5.AI Algorithms:** Leveraging logistic regression, decision tree classifier, and NLP techniques enables the system to analyze textual data and make informed decisions about the truthfulness of statements.
