<h1 align="center">⭐G!F -Fact Verification Project⭐</h1>


## About the Project
The aim of this project is to develop a user-friendly web application that empowers users to verify the facts they encounter online. By leveraging advanced AI algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree classifier, and NLP, the system can analyze textual data and make informed decisions about the veracity of statements.
This project aims to develop a web application using logistic regression, decision tree classifier, and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to determine the truthfulness of facts. Initially trained and tested using a geography dataset, the project intends to expand the database to cover a wider range of topics and domains in the future.
