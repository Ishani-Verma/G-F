AI Fact Verification Project-G!F
Overview
This project is aimed at developing a web application that uses logistic regression, decision tree classifier, and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to determine the truthfulness of facts. Initially, the system is trained and tested using a geography dataset. However, the intention is to expand the database in the future to cover a wider range of topics and domains.


Why This Project?
1.Combatting Misinformation: In today's digital age, the spread of misinformation and fake news is a significant concern. By developing a fact verification system, we contribute to the efforts of combating misinformation and promoting accurate information dissemination.

2.Enhancing Information Integrity: Ensuring the integrity of information is crucial, especially in domains where factual accuracy is paramount, such as news reporting, academic research, and public information dissemination.

3.Empowering Users: Providing users with a tool to verify the truthfulness of facts empowers them to make informed decisions, avoid spreading false information, and engage critically with online content.
